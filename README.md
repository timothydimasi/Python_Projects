# Python_Projects
Projects and assignments written in Python

## Noteworthy Items

### Django
There are two projects housed in this folder.
The first is called DjangoUniversity and its purpose was to help me become more comfortable with creating a project with Django/Pycharm.
The second is djangoCheckbook and it allows the user to create profiles and transactions specific to each profile.

### File Transfer
This is a small application that I built which transfers files from folder to folder.
The GUI was crafted with Tkinter and the logic was written in Python.

### Web Page Generator
As the name implies, this application will create a web page based on text entered by the user.
This was made with Tkinter/Python just as the previous project.
